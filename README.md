Machine learning-based prediction of COVID-19 diagnosis based on symptoms

In this project we used various algorithms to find out the whether a person is covid positve or not based on various symptoms that paticular individual has.
A speedy and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 is made possible by effective SARS-CoV-2 screening, which can also lessen the burden on healthcare systems. There have been built prediction models that assess the likelihood of infection by combining a number of parameters. These are meant to help medical professionals all over the world treat patients, especially in light of the scarcity of healthcare resources. The current dataset has been downloaded from a government website and contains around 2,78,848 individuals who have gone through the RT-PCR test. Data set contains 11 columns, including 8 features suspected to play an important role in the prediction of COVID19 outcome. Outcome variable is covid result test positive or negative.

Predicting diseases accurately using machine learning can significantly improve medical treatment in several ways:
Early Detection:

1. Machine learning identifies subtle patterns in data, enabling the early detection of diseases before symptoms manifest. This facilitates timely intervention and improves treatment outcomes.
Personalized Treatment:

2. ML analyzes individual patient data to tailor treatment plans, considering genetic, lifestyle, and medical factors. Personalized medicine enhances treatment effectiveness and minimizes adverse effects.
Resource Efficiency:

3. Predictive models assist in optimizing resource allocation within healthcare institutions, ensuring efficient staffing, equipment utilization, and overall operational effectiveness.
Cost Reduction:

4. Accurate disease prediction reduces healthcare costs by preventing complications, minimizing unnecessary procedures, and streamlining resource usage, leading to more cost-effective healthcare delivery.
Improved Decision Support:

5. ML algorithms provide healthcare professionals with evidence-based decision support, analyzing patient data and medical literature to enhance the accuracy and consistency of clinical decisions.
